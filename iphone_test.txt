I was ordering a new clutch and timing belt kit this week so if it's timing, that's getting taken care of.
But what a breeze your company is.
I've been looking at the hurst short throw and people are really iffy about it, I'm going to check out the maddog with that much reduction and not so tight that seems like my best bet cuz this clutch is already going to be tight so a smoother shifter would make it worth while Man I wonder what goes through people heads when they do that then they stand back cross there arms shake head up and down and say daaamn that looks good.
As a Canongate member I can attest to what a great course Bentwater is.

It was smashed and totaled as it sat in front of my home.
Flop beat me to it.

I now only rest my toe on the lever and only use the front.
When if they would just give it maybe a little more time to get used to it, it would perfect.
I have read so much about the problems with the rear end so I decided to do the change.
I figured.
I'll be completely honest and say I know what to change to get better welds and such but the actual theroy behind all the settings I have no idea.
